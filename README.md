# NKA Academic Management System (NKA-AMS)

**A modular, Dockerised academic management platform built with Laravel 11 and a multi-guard RBAC architecture.**

---

## Quick start (Docker)

### Prerequisites
- Docker + Docker Compose v2

### First run (fresh clone)
```bash
cp .env.example .env    # optional: entrypoint will auto-create .env if missing
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose exec laravel composer install
docker compose exec laravel php artisan key:generate --force
docker compose exec laravel php artisan storage:link
docker compose exec laravel php artisan migrate --seed
```

> **Dependency Storage Note**
>
> - PHP dependencies (`vendor/`) are installed into the project directory via the Laravel container.
> - Node dependencies (`node_modules/`) are stored in a Docker named volume to keep the repository clean and improve performance.


For a detailed explanation of the Docker runtime lifecycle, entrypoint behaviour, bind-mount implications, and Composer installation strategy, see:

[Docker Setup Documentation](./docs/docker-setup.md)

### Access points
| Service     | URL                     |
| ----------- | ----------------------- |
| Application | `http://localhost:8000` |
| phpMyAdmin  | `http://localhost:8080` |
> All services communicate via Docker internal networking. No internal service relies on `localhost`.

## 1. System Overview

The **NKA Academic Management System (NKA-AMS)** is a Laravel-based web application designed to support structured academic administration workflows within higher education and vocational training environments.

The system is engineered around a **multi-stakeholder architecture** and emphasises:

* role and permission-based access control (RBAC)

* guard-level authentication separation

* centralised session management

* reproducible containerised environments

* documentation-driven engineering discipline

This repository represents the **engineering baseline** of the system and serves as the foundation for requirement-driven functional expansion.

***

## 2. Architectural Principles

The system is designed according to the following principles:

### Separation of Concerns

Authentication, session storage, caching, queue handling, and database persistence are isolated at the infrastructure level.

### Stateless Application Layer

The Laravel container is stateless. Persistent state is externalised to Redis and MariaDB.

### Deterministic Multi-Guard Authentication

Each stakeholder type operates under a dedicated guard with explicit session and access boundaries.

### Infrastructure Reproducibility

Docker and Docker Compose guarantee environment parity across development machines.

### Documentation-First Development

Architectural decisions are formalised and versioned alongside code changes.

## 3. Technical Stack
| Layer                          | Technology                                           |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Framework                      | Laravel 11 (PHP 8.2)                                 |
| Authentication & Authorisation | Multi-guard architecture + Spatie Laravel Permission |
| UI Framework                   | AdminLTE                                             |
| Frontend Tooling               | Vite + Node.js                                       |
| Database                       | MariaDB (Dockerised)                                 |
| State Layer                    | Redis (phpredis extension)                           |
| Environment                    | Docker & Docker Compose                              |
| Testing                        | Isolated environment via `.env.testing`              |

---
## 4. Development Environment (Docker)

The system runs in a fully containerised development environment.

### Core Services

* **Laravel Application Container** (PHP runtime)

* **Nginx** (HTTP server)

* **MariaDB** (persistent data)

* **Redis** (state layer)

* **Node / Vite** (asset compilation)

* **phpMyAdmin** (optional development utility)

### Start the environment
```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

## 5. Environment Configuration

The project uses structured environment separation:
| File           | Purpose                                         |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `.env`         | Local development configuration (not committed) |
| `.env.example` | Configuration template                          |
| `.env.testing` | Isolated testing configuration                  |

Sensitive values (keys, credentials, secrets) are excluded from version control.

***
## 6. Redis State Architecture

Redis functions as the centralised state layer of the system and is responsible for:

* HTTP session storage

* application caching

* queue transport backend

To ensure isolation and predictability, Redis uses dedicated logical databases:
| Function | Redis DB |
| -------- | -------- |
| Sessions | DB 0     |
| Cache    | DB 1     |
| Queue    | DB 2     |

Key characteristics:

* dedicated cache key prefix (`CACHE_PREFIX`)

* dedicated session key prefix (`SESSION_PREFIX`)

* queue lists stored as `queues:<queue-name>`

* no global Redis prefix at connection level

* Docker service name used as Redis hostname (no internal localhost coupling)

This structure enables:

* horizontal scalability

* cross-container session consistency

* deterministic queue processing

* key-collision prevention

Redis usage can be independently verified via CLI-level inspection.

## 7. Repository Structure (High-Level)
| Directory    | Purpose                                   |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `app/`       | Core application logic                    |
| `config/`    | Framework and architectural configuration |
| `database/`  | Migrations and seeders                    |
| `docker/`    | Container definitions and scripts         |
| `resources/` | Views and frontend assets                 |
| `routes/`    | Route definitions                         |
| `storage/`   | Logs, cache, runtime data                 |

## 8. Versioning Strategy

The repository follows a milestone-based versioning model.

The current baseline release establishes:

* multi-guard authentication structure

* Redis-backed state management

* Dockerised environment reproducibility

* architectural documentation alignment

Functional modules are introduced only after formalised requirement validation.

***

## 9. System Integrity Guarantees

The architecture ensures:

* single-session enforcement consistency

* container restart safety (no session loss)

* externalised persistent state

* infrastructure-layer separation of responsibilities

This design supports safe scaling without architectural modification.

***

## 10. Infrastructure Verification

For detailed Redis verification procedures (Cache / Queue / Session), including CLI-based proof steps, see:

* [Docker Services – Redis Verification](./docs/docker-services.md#redis-verification)

This section documents how to:

* verify Redis cache storage (DB 1),

* verify Redis queue processing (DB 2),

* verify Redis session storage (DB 0),

* confirm prefix behaviour and configuration alignment.
